# 🛢️ Oil Spill Detection Project

## 📋 Overview
The Oil Spill Detection Project aims to automatically identify oil spill regions in satellite images using deep learning. The model is designed to be **lightweight yet accurate**, leveraging a U-Net-based segmentation architecture to detect oil spill areas from raw SAR or satellite imagery.
